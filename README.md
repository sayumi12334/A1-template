Assignment for FIT1008/FIT2085 - A1

## Introduction
Welcome to the Card Game Assignment! This assignment is designed to help you learn the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures by implementing a card game. Below are the details of the game, its rules, and your tasks. Good luck and have fun!

## Game Overview
The card game involves multiple players and a deck of cards. The objective is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards. Each card has a color and a label, and there are special black cards with unique abilities.

## Important Restrictions and Assumptions
- You cannot use any built-in data structures (including tuples!) or algorithms from any libraries, except the ones we give you in the scaffold (and no, you cannot modify the code for these ones either). 
- This means that the use of Python in-built lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets (among other built-in data structures) is forbidden. In addition to this, ArrayR is also prohibited.
- You cannot use any built-in sorting algorithms. You must use one of the sorting algorithms given to you in the scaffold OR use a data structure that facilitates sorting algorithms.
- You cannot change the import statements in the Python files. Please do not ask if you can use any external libraries on Ed, as the answer will always be no.
- You cannot use generative AI, machine learning, or any other form of AI software.
- You cannot use any hard-coded constant numbers. Please use the numbers provided in config.py.
- You cannot access the internals of ANY data structures or any classes except the custom classes that you edit in the tasks. You can only access the methods of the data structures that are provided to you in the scaffold. Each use of the internals of a data structure will count as a major mistake and will lose at least half of the marks for the task.
- The submitted program will be tested using Python version 3.10.0 or later.
